## The Context API - What is it?

> In a typical React application, data is passed top-down (parent to child) via props, but this can be cumbersome for certain types of props (e.g. locale preference, UI theme) that are required by many components within an application. Context provides a way to share values like these between components without having to explicitly pass a prop through every level of the tree.  
> [React Docs - Context API](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html)

- Provider
- Consumer
- CreateContext (provider/comsumer pair)

Scenario:

- Your React app can switch between a two UI themes, eg: Night (Dark), Day (Light).
- Every UI component in your React app will have to change it's color.

Demo: [React Context API - Extended Theme Example](https://codesandbox.io/s/4jxm37239x)

- Talk through how the demo is working
- File order:
	+ theme-context.js
	+ theme-button.js
	+ index.js

This is all well and good, but how can the deep button change state?





## Don't use props for...

> **Note:** Donâ€™t use context just to avoid passing props a few levels down. Stick to cases where the same data needs to be accessed in many components at multiple levels.
